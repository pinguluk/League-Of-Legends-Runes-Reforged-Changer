## Will I get banned for using this?

Riot Sargonas has stated the following on the matter:



>This one is is in an gray area. It does a lot more interactions for the user than we typically consider ok, though the time and place it does it (masteries page) is a lot less sensitive than, say, in game.

It's not something we can make a snap judgement on at this time without careful consideration, but we're definitely not 100% okay with the idea yet due to the fact it's scripting player actions, even though in the out-of-game client.

>We typically don't ban for using a tool like this without an announcement. Further more, usage of these kinds of tools usually result in a warning and a temp ban before a permanent ban being the last step.

I can't give you any kind of update now or anytime in the immediate future, but I can say that you will not wake up to a sudden and un-expected ban without warning by using this tool.

**TL;DR:** Currently, you will not be banned for using it. And if Riot eventually decides that this *is* against the ToS, there would be fair warning before any permanent ban takes place against your account. So for now, happy mastery assigning :wink:
